## Heyyyyy guys!

**This is Lucas and one more time I'm here to post other framework. The goal was just to know more about estatistics because that the framework is very simple **


The ttest_real was used to found a hypothesis between void or accepts. The dataset for analyze was built with numpy.array and very values under it. When you put a new  value on frameowrk it going to analyze if the new value can get in on dataset ou not. The new date is treaty with some's tools for exemple .mean() and .std() to know the new value will get in the dataset or will be considered as out line.
